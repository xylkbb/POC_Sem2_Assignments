Write a program that ask the user for two numbers.

Then output the division of those two numbers.  

You should have two try except blocks.  

One to handle the user input (ValueError)

Another to handle dividing by zero (ZeroDivisionError)

Something like this

number1 = 0
number2 = 0
try:
    # user input stuff setting number1 and number2
except ValueError:
    # print message stating that an integer wasn't given

try:
    #divide number1 / number2
except ZeroDivisionError:
    #print message stating that division by zero is not possible.
