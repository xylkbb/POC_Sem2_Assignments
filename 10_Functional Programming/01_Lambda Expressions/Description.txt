Create 3 lambda expressions and set each equal to a variable

Create one variable named product and set it to a lambda that takes two numbers and returns their product
Create one variable named quotient and set it to a lambda that takes two numbers and retursn their quotient
Create one variable named exponent and set it to a lambda that atkes two numbers and returns the first raised to the power of the second

Call these three lambda
product(15, 13)
quotient(15, 13)
exponent(3, 7)
